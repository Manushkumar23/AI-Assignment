##Objective of the Project

The objective of the Sales Forecasting Project is to utilize historical sales data to predict future sales and provide actionable insights. By employing time-series analysis

##Tools and Libraries Used

The text describes a data collection and storage system using  Excel, NumPy, and scipy, as well as time-series analysis, machine learning, and visualization tools like Matplotlib, Plotly, and a development environment using Google colab.

##Data Source(s)


The text provides a comprehensive overview of various data sources used for business analysis, including internal data, publicly available economic data, online marketplaces, simulated data, and third-party data providers.


##Execution Steps (How to run the project)


This text outlines the process of predicting future sales based on historical time-series data. It covers data collection, preprocessing, EDA, model selection, evaluation, forecasting, visualization, deployment, and maintenance. The model is evaluated using error metrics and visualized on charts. It also includes a dashboard for real-time predictions.


##Summary of Results


The ARIMA model was used to analyze sales data, revealing strong seasonality and upward trends. It was used for forecasting sales with 95% confidence intervals, providing business insights and identifying anomalies. The model was deployed as an API and retrained periodically.


##Challenges Faced


Data quality issues include missing values, outliers, noise, and irregularities. Data complexity and seasonality are addressed using models like SARIMA or Prophet. Stationarity and differencing are ensured through differencing. Model selection and tuning, data granularity and aggregation, long-term forecasting, model interpretation, business application, real-time data and scalability, and external factors are addressed.
